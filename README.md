This tool can be used to import markdown documents into Confluence.  It is a fork of [RittmanMead/md_to_conf](https://github.com/RittmanMead/md_to_conf), upgraded to Python 3.11 and the Confluence v2 APIs.

The file is converted to HTML and uploaded to Confluence using their `storage` representation.  The following functionality is supported:

1. Inline images
2. Code blocks
3. Some custom markdown tags
